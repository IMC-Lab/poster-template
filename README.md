# poster-template
A LaTeX template for making posters presented by the IMC Lab

To use, follow this checklist:
- delete the line `\usepackage{blindtext}                              %% for filler text- delete this line`
- add your references to references.bib (you can download these from Google Scholar as BibTex entries)
- replace the `\blindtext` with your own text/figures

You may need to adjust the number, placement, or titles of the poster blocks. For more information, please see the [tikzposter documentation](https://mirror.ox.ac.uk/sites/ctan.org/graphics/pgf/contrib/tikzposter/tikzposter.pdf).
